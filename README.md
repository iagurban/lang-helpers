# 🔗 [WIP] [Live Demo](https://iagurban.github.io/lang-helpers/)

A system of compact, logic-driven tools designed to deconstruct language rules. This project replaces rote memorization with systematic understanding, based on independent research into the mechanics of grammar.

## **🧠 About**

Language is a system. This project "logicalizes" grammar by embedding complex rules into unified visual systems. By using symbolic and color-coding, we reduce the cognitive load required to understand the "Big Picture" of a language.

## **🇬🇧 English: The Tenses Matrix**

An interactive playground designed for testing and visualizing the English verb system.

While standard academic labels are included for reference, this tool visualizes tenses using a new mental framework. It maps complex aspects to **four states of existence with two colors** — **Doing**, **Being**, **Having**, and **Having after Being** — which helps to systematically memoize the logic behind every tense.

**Key Features:**

* **Interactive Testing:** Input *any* verb to instantly generate its forms across all times and aspects.
* **Visual Logic:** Uses color-coding to make the relationship between the states intuitively obvious.

## **🇷🇸 Serbian: Grammar Logic Engine**

A comprehensive attempt to capture **every single rule** of the Serbian language into a unified visual system.

**Key Features:**

* **Total Coverage:** Spans from fundamental word formation to complex sentence structures.
* **Symbolic Schematics:** Rules are condensed into high-density tables that utilize **symbols, colors, and legends**. This allows complex patterns (and their exceptions) to be read like a technical blueprint rather than a textbook.
* **Compact Density:** Designed to present the maximum amount of grammatical information in the minimum amount of screen space.
